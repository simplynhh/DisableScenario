# DisableScenario

This is a working example of deleting a scenario vehicle spawn for FiveM server. This file can be drag and dropped into your server resource folder. This resource removes the sports car spawn in the red car park at San Andreas Avenue. For scenario editing, you may need to use CodeWalker to check for the scenario. 

*IMPORTANT*: .#mt files need to be signed in CodeWalker. If not your server will not recognise the file and crash the server.
